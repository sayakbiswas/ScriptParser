Hey, there, Sidney.  I am early.  I mean I am Phil and I am early.  I am glad you're early too, well, sort of. I was hoping to beat you and get used to the room first.  I get nervous in new places.  And with new people.  I get nervous a lot.  I brought you flowers.PHILThe flowers are a little wilted.  They were pretty.  I mean there is this wonderful flower shop but I did not have time to go there today but I did a few days ago and I wanted those flowers.  I do not get a date every day you know and I wanted this to be special, so I got the best flowers I know of but I want this to be great.  You know what I mean.PHILWhat's with the mask?PHILNot really... it is just... weird.PHILI have to admit.  I am a little curious.  Why would you wear an old person mask to dinner?  And do the weird voice?PHILTell me about it.PHILI am not?PHILReally?  You do too.PHILWhat?PHILBut you said my eyes... and your eyes are.. well... pretty...PHILBut...PHILCan't I?PHILOkay.PHILI like red.  You like red?PHILWhy is that?PHILIt is good to feel something.PHILA least those colors feel something.  Black and white is so boring.  No feeling at all.PHILIs that battered green beans?PHILThat is my absolute favorite!PHILNobody else likes these.PHILThese are so good in the honey poppy seed sauce.PHILOh, no you did not?PHILWhat are the odds we'd like the same things?PHILSo... uh... what else happens on these dates?  I mean... you seem to have had it all planned out with the mask and such.  It is like a test or something.  There was this one episode of Star Trek...PHILReally?PHILEarl Grey tea... hot.PHILSo is this one of those Trekkie tests of the true nature of a species?  What is the next trial?PHILHmmm... I shall take this challenge.PHILAlready know what you want?PHILWhat are you having?PHILI'll take this challenge.PHILI will take your dinner challenge.PHILI too will have the unusual usual.PHILI am brave.  I'll try anything once.PHILI did not see anything too unusual on the menu.Phil gets nervous.PHILOh.PHILI really do not want to look like that.PHILUh... uh... I am sorry.  I did not mean to...PHILMaybe I should wear a mask on dates too.  I get so nervous.PHILIt is the mask.  It is helping me too for some reason.  It is so ridiculous... I guess it lightens the mood.PHILNo, you've very normal.  The rest of us are weird.PHILThat was quick. I'll get it.PHILA hot dog?PHILMost unusual.PHILI actually love hot dogs.PHILYup.PHILUh... I do not know... maybe... I guess... this is a test too is not it.  Oh man.PHILOkay.PHILUgly?PHILI do not mind. I am no William Shatner.PHILI am sure I am not William Shatner.PHILI am sure.  I already know you have beautiful eyes.PHILI still can't compliment you?PHILYou do not have to take off the mask.  It is okay.PHILYou're beautiful.PHILYou are... really.PHILYou do not have any reason to hide.PHILSure.
